# AML MRD ML
This is the repository related to the manuscript titled "A machine learning approach for the rapid identification of measurable residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia". The script is named "main_pipeline.ipynb". If you want to run with the explainability feature, the script is titled "explainability_module.ipynb". There are also two practice files; a csv training dataset and a sample test fcs file.
Enjoy and feel free to contact me if you get errors or have any suggestions!
